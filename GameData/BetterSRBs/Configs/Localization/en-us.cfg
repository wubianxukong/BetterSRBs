        #BSRB Slotted06 title = Slotted Tube, 6-slots
        #BSRB Slotted06 detail = Thrust starts at 76% of average, progresses to 113%, then continues neutral before rapidly decaying.  This grain produces an average thrust 80% that of the default, with a longer burn time.
        #BSRB Slotted08 title = Slotted Tube, 8-slots
        #BSRB Slotted08 detail = Thrust starts at 100% of average, progresses to 124%, then regresses to 80% before rapidly decaying.  This fuel grain is considered the default, having standard thrust and burn time.
        #BSRB Slotted10 title = Slotted Tube, 10-slots
        #BSRB Slotted10 detail = Thrust starts at 124% of average, progresses to 138%, then regresses to 63% before rapidly decaying.  This grain produces an average thrust 120% that of the default, with a shorter burn time.

        #BSRB ADTP title = Kerbodyne ADTP-1-1.5
        #BSRB ADTP des = An adapter to attach 1.875m parts to 1.25m parts.
        #BSRB NoseConeMk4 title = Protective Rocket Nose Cone Mk4
        #BSRB NoseConeMk4 des = A medium nose cone for covering up exposed areas of medium rockets.
        #BSRB RamSRB title = BACC Mk2 "Ram" Solid Fuel Booster
        #BSRB RamSRB des = Based on the original BACC solid fuel booster, the Mk2 introduces a 1.875-meter diameter casing, dwarfing all previous SRB models.
        #BSRB Lance title = S2 SRB-KD50 "Lance" Solid Fuel Booster
        #BSRB Lance des = The model KD50 is the pinnacle in SRB manufacturing and design. This massive booster should satisfy all your heavy lifitng needs.
